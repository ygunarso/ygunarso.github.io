            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>In the laboratory environment I currently work in, I am known for being proactive and always enthusiastic to learn about new technology. I believe that my considerable experience in a variety of programming languages (C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript) through coursework and personal projects can significantly contribute to this project from the very first day. Aspects of my technical expertise that I lack can be compensated for in my ability to learn and grasp concepts quickly and thoroughly. The vast scope of my interests can offer a different perspective to the team that I will be working with. I am a great admirer of innovators and pioneers who lived before me and it would be an honor to be working in an environment where these great minds were. I aspire to contribute to the development of technology in a company who helped transform the technological world to what it is today.</p>
